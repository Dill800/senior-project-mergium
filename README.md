# senior-project-mergium
Project I made for my senior project in high school. Made in JavaFX.

Program based on Pokemon, but instead of evolution you can merge two entities to create a child entity that has the best features from both parents. 
Features include a type system, different builds (representations) of creatures, items, and File I/O.
